About yourself: I want to learn JS/HTML/CSS to work on site development. My goal is to become a Front-end developer. My strengths are that I persist and always bring the case to the end. There is no experience in the company, but I work on my home projects. Always ready to learn new things.
> There is no limit to perfection.

Examples of my code:
for (i = 0; i <= 364; i++) {
	console.log('Good day for you')
} 
```

Education: A number of courses have been held in the JS and the JS base.

My level of English: A1
