About yourself: I want to learn JS/HTML/CSS to work on site development. My goal is to become a Front-end developer. My strengths are that I persist and always bring the case to the end. There is no experience in the company, but I work on my home projects. Always ready to learn new things. > There is no limit to perfection.
